      <h2>About Parallax Website</h2>
      <p>
       If you’re thinking about using parallax as a visual effect for your website but feel unsure if it is the right choice, you’ve come to the right place. In this post, you will learn what is parallax, methods that are commonly used in applying it, its pros and cons, and some tips for implementing it.

What is Parallax Web Design? Parallax, or parallax scrolling, is a unique web design technique that involves motion graphics effect to create the illusion of depth on a website. In parallax scrolling, background images move slower than foreground images as you scroll down the web page, resulting in a 2D effect.

History of Parallax Web Design Parallax is derived from the Greek word parallaxi, which means “alteration”. In the 1980s, the parallax effect was used in video games, such as Star Force, Street Fighter II, and Sonic the Hedgehog. A few years later, it found its way into web design.

Principles of Parallax Web Design Now that you have a basic understanding of what parallax is, let’s take a look at the guiding principles that every web designer utilising parallax should keep in mind.

      <p>
        A site with parallax scrolling isn’t like your traditional website. On conventional sites, the content hierarchy often acts like a flow chart, where the most important content is placed at the top of the page. Thus, this provides users with a structured and organised web experience. However, this often lacks the dynamism that some users expect in modern-day websites. Enter parallax design. It offers a unique scrolling experience similar to leafing through the pages of a book, so instead of just reading your web content, users are more engaged in the narrative as they scroll down your page.

        Highlight your Unique Selling Proposition (USP). When you put your USP in your headlines, apply the parallax effect to make them animated and attractive. After all, you’re trying to tell a narrative to engage your users. What better way to catch their attention and keep them interested than a dynamic web element like parallax scrolling?

        Add context in the form of icons or images. Icons and images provide entertainment value to your website visitors which helps deepen their engagement and improve your conversion rate.

    </div>

    <section class="section section-dark" id="section-dark">
      <h2>Principal four</h2>
      <p>
        Less is more. Keep your background layer simple to minimise confusion and sensory overload. Stick to what you think is right for the needs of your users and the narrative you want to tell. Using parallax with other techniques may only distract your users instead of helping them easily understand what your website is about.
